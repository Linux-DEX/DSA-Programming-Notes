# Basic 

## What is Cloud computing
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

| On-premise                      | Cloud Providers                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| you own the servers             | Someone else owns the servers                                                                          |
| you hire the IT people          | Someone else hires the IT people                                                                       |
| You pay or rent the real-estate | Someone else pays or rents the real-estate                                                             |
| You take all the risk           | You are responsible for your configuring cloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest. |

## The Evolution of Cloud hosting
1. **Dedicated Server**
	- *One Physical machine* dedicated *to single a business.*
	- Runs a single web-app/site.
	- `Very expensive, high maintenance, High security`

2. **Virtual Private Server(VPS)**
	- *One physical machine* dedicated *to a single business.*
	- The physical machine is virtualized *into sub-machines.*
	- Runs multiple web-apps/sites.
	- `Better Utilization and isolation of resources`

3. **Shared Hosting**
	- *One physical machine*, shared by *hundred of businesses.* 
	- Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources.
	- `Very cheap, limited functionality, Poor isolation`

4. **Cloud Hosting**
	- *Multiple physical machines* that act as one system.
	- The system is abstracted into multiple *cloud services*
	- `Flexible, scalable, secure, Cost-effective, high configurability`

## Common Cloud Services
A cloud provider **can have hundreds of cloud services** that are grouped various types of services. The four most common types of cloud services for Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) would be: 

1. **Compute**: Imagine having a virtual computer that can run application, programs and code.
2. **Storage**: Imagine having a virtual hard-drive that can store files.
3. **Networking**: Imagine having the virtual network being able to define internet connections or network isolations.
4. **Databases**: Imagine a virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-application.

## What is Microsoft and Azure
**Microsoft**
+ An american multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Redmond, washington
+ Microsoft makes software, phones, tables, game consoles, cloud services, a search engine and more!
+ Microsoft has been around since the late 1970s and is well known for their Operating system windows.

**Azure**
+ Microsoft calls their cloud provider service Microsoft azure.
+ commonly referred to just Azure
+ Azure literally means bright blue color of the cloudless sky.
+ Cloud service providers can be initialized as CSPs

## Benefits of cloud computing
+ **Cost-effective** : you pay for what you consume, no up-font cost. Pay-as-you-go(PAYG) thousands of customers sharing the cost of the resources.
+ **Global** : Launch workloads anywhere in the world, just choose a region.
+ **Secure** : Cloud provider takes care of physical security. Cloud services can by secure by default.
+ **Reliable** : Data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication, and fault tolerance.
+ **Scalable** : Increase or decrease resources and services based on demand.
+ **Elastic** : Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand.
+ **Current** : The underlying hardware and managed software is patched, upgraded and replaced by the cloud provider without interruption to you.

## Types of Cloud Computing
1. **SaaS(Software as a Service)**
	- A product that is run and managed by the service provider *Don't worry about how the service is maintained.*
	- *It just works and remains available.*
2. **PaaS(Platform as a Service)**
	- Focus on the deployment and management of your apps.
	- *Don't worry about, provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or OS.*
3. **IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service)** 
	- The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space.
	- *Don't worry about IT staff, data center and hardware.*
