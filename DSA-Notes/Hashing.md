# Hashing

Hashing is a technique used in data structures that efficiently stores and retrieves data in a way that allows for quick access. It involves mapping data to a specific index in a hash table using a hash function that enables fast retrieval of information based on its key

- **Example**
  - for this example consider the array of size 5 with element \[ 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 7 \]
  - created array of size 2^n for the integer type.
  - first select the 1st element in add into new array for at the index of the array element. similarly for other element.
  - while accessing access the count at that specific index.
