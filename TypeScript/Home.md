# TypeScript

Typescript is a syntactic superset of javascript which adds **static typing.**
This basically means that Typescript adds syntax on top of javascript, allowing developers to add **types**.

**What does typescript do**

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. 
- It helps developers catch errors early by checking the types of variables, function parameters, and return values during development. 
- TypeScript code is then compiled into regular JavaScript, which can be run in any browser or JavaScript environment. 
- This improves code quality, makes large codebases easier to manage, and enhances developer productivity with features like auto-completion and better refactoring support.
